The code first imports the necessary libraries, including cv2, mediapipe, and time.

It then initializes a video capture object and sets the minimum detection confidence to 0.75.

A while loop is used to continuously read frames from the video capture object.

For each frame, the code converts the image to RGB color space and then detects faces using the mediapipe.solutions.face_detection library.

If faces are detected, the code draws a bounding box around each face and displays the confidence score on the output screen.

The code also calculates the FPS of the video and displays it on the output screen.

The code ends when the user presses the q key.

The mediapipe.solutions.face_detection library uses a deep learning model to detect faces in images and videos. The model is trained on a dataset of millions of faces, so it can reliably detect faces in a variety of lighting conditions and poses.

The confidence score is a measure of how confident the model is that it has detected a face. A higher confidence score means that the model is more likely to be correct.

The bounding box is a rectangular region that surrounds the face. The coordinates of the bounding box are relative to the size of the image.
